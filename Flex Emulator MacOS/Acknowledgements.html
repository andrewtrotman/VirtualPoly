As the copyright holder to FLEX - I am giving you permission
to do what you please - which includes making some bucks -
if possible.<br>
<br>
It was a fun time of the computer era which few will never
know - so if you can share some of that love for 4KB, 8 byte
computers - more power to you!<br>
<br>
Just one requirement.  I get notified or a copy of anything
you do. You have my full support!<br>

FLEX User Group asks::<br>
In fact, if you have stopped selling the FLEX program
so long ago, would you consider releasing them to
public domain (unsupported of course)?<br>
<br>
Robert replies:<br>
I don't see any harm in that.<br>

1. I, Robert Jones, of 33383 Lynn Avenue, Abbotsford, B.C., CANADA
V2S 1E2, hereby certify that I am the author of the 6809 and 68000
versions of the FLEX program known as RBASIC, and the author of
the upgraded ancillary programs known as RENUMBER and ERRORS.SYS.
I am also the author of the 6809 and 68000 versions of the
upgraded XPC PreCompiler program now known as RPC.<br>
<br>
2, I hereby transfer to Mr. Frank Wilson, of 5202 23rd Ave S.W.,
Seattle, WA 98106, U.S.A., both the source-code and instruction
manuals for all programs in Clause 1 above authored by me, and all
rights pertaining thereto, for use by the FLEX USERS' GROUP,
subject to the following three provisos :<br>
<br>
(i) That all copies of these programs and their appropriate
instruction manuals include an acknowledgment that I, Robert
Jones, am the author thereof. Such as "Courtesy of Robert Jones,

<br>
(ii) That the program names RBASIC and RPC remain unchanged.<br>
<br>
(iii) That, in deference to the many months I spent in
developing these two programs, my British spelling be preserved
throughout the source-code and the manuals.<br>

The status of this compiler is unknown.  It appears to have subsequently been sold
to Microware who no longer support it.<br>

<h2>Scott Adams Adventures</h2>

Wikipedia states:<br>
Adventure International went bankrupt in 1986. The copyrights for its games reverted to the bank and eventually back to Scott Adams who released them as shareware.<br>

<h2>Colossal Cave Adventure</h2>
Copyright (c) Jack Doremus<br>
Jack states:<br>
Copyrights are good for 20 years, and the date on my
TX-1 form is February 1981. HOWEVER, I hereby renounce
all copyright rights to "Adventure for the 6800/09",
and if you want to use it for whatever purposes including
for profit, FEEL FREE!!  As long as it comes up reading
"by Jack Doremus", I've got my credit.<br>

<h2>VED</h2>
VED appears to have come from the Aztec C65 C compiler distribution and
to have been modified by several people along the way, including porting to
FLEX and making it more like vi.  The source code was distributed (as VEDSRC.ARC)
in the C65 distribution and is, therefore, assumed to be open source.  According to
the Wikipedia "Aztec C remains copyrighted and has not been placed into the public
domain. Harry Suckow, who started Manx Software Systems with partners Thomas
Fenwick and James Goodnow II, is the copyright holder."

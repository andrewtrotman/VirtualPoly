@THIS EXAMPLE SHOWS HOW COMMANDS AND TEXT CAN BE INTERMIXED FOR LATER PROCESSING BY A TEXT PROCESSOR.
@THE EXAMPLE STARTED BY CENTRING TWO LINES FOLLOWED BY A SINGLE INDENT TO SIGNIFY THE START OF A PARAGRAPH.
@THE CAPITALIZATION MODE IS ON AND THE UPPER CASE SHIFT CHARACTERS ARE BEING USED

@THE ADJUST MODE WAS JUST CHANGED TO CENTRING AS WELL AS A LINE LENGTH OF 45.
@THE LEFT MARGIN WAS SET TO 10 TO GIVE A NICELY CENTRED NARROW LINE.
@SPECIAL EFFECTS LIKE THESE ARE EASILY ACCOMPLISHED.

@THE PARAMETERS WERE JUST SWITCHED BACK SO THE LINE APPEARANCE WILL BE RESTORED.
@THIS IS A SHORT EXAMPLE BUT SHOULD SHOW HOW THE COMMANDS CAN BE INTEGRATED WITH TEXT.
